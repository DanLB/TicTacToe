    Welcome to my site. Here you can see the projects I've been working on.
    <br />
    Currently, there is a simple TicTacToe game using the Html5 Canvas and Golang. I used it to practice the Go programming language and the new Javascript canvas. All game validation and processing happens on the server.
    I also have an interval ear training project which uses Html5 Audio.
    <br />
    I programming a blog as a learning experience. I am working on it piece by piece as I have time. Eventually I would like to upload it here.
