    Welcome to my site. Here you can see the projects I've been working on.
    <br />
    Currently, there is only the tictactoe game which is in progress using the Html5 Canvas.
    I also have an interval ear training project which I will upload hopefully soon which uses Html5 Audio.
    <br />
    I would also like to program a blog as a learning experience. That will be a longer term project.
